## Overall Learning 

> Through this course, I gained a solid understanding of how real-world security systems function and how vulnerabilities arise. I learned to think from both attacker and defender perspectives, which improved my analytical and problem-solving skills. Overall, the course helped me develop a strong security mindset and the ability to approach cybersecurity challenges in a structured, ethical, and practical way.

<!-- Project 1 -->
<h3 id="project1">Data Encryption & Decryption tool with added functionality</h3>
<p>
 The Data Encryption and Decryption Tool is a cybersecurity project designed to protect sensitive files from unauthorized access and data leakage. It allows users to securely encrypt and decrypt files using a secret key, verify data integrity, and safely delete files to prevent recovery. With both graphical and command-line interfaces, the project demonstrates practical application of cryptographic principles and strengthens secure software development and security analysis skills.

## **Learnings from LST and SST**

<!-- add your experiences over here -->
> _The LSD session was very insightful. It highlighted the importance of good habits, such as helping others and sharing, along with communication and body language, which will help me improve both personally and professionally.

## **Community Services**

As part of my Community, I contributed by providing food to those in need and participating in tree-planting activities. Giving food to others was a rewarding experience, as it allowed me to directly support and help the community while understanding the value of empathy and service. Planting trees also gave me a sense of contributing to a greener and healthier environment.


### **Activities Involved** Provided food to underprivileged individuals in Rajahmundry. This experience helped me understand the importance of compassion and community service.
